<!-- wrote boiler plate code by just doing HTML:5 -->
<!-- Q1. How does a browser understand that what are these things like document.createElement, document.getElementById?
    Ans. Browser has an inbuilt engine to understand javascript code (things document, createElement, getElementById..)
    Q2. Does browser understand react code?
    Ans. No, it doesn't, React libraries are hosted on CDNs (content delivery network) and we fetch react libraries from there
